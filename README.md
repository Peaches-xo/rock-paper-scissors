# rock-paper-scissors
The Odin Project // Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Goal - Phase 1:
  Create a console version of rock, paper, scissors to get the logic down. 
  First step -> write out pseudocode of expected inputs & outputs.
  
Goal - Phase 2: 
  Create a GUI with buttons & text to upgrade the playing experience. 
  
  Ideas -> I would like to have closed fist icons/ images that bounce up and down similar to how you would move your hands playing IRL.
  On the third 'bounce', both choices would be revealed. The results would then be stored in a table to visually keep track of past choices 
  & who is winning. Bounce could be added with CSS animation/ keyframes but would need to look into this further.
